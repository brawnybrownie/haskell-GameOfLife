This game of life implementation is just a side project to dig deeper
into functional programming. I have been using OOP for about a decade
now and hence FP is sometimes a pain. Also, with a daily job circling
around OOP, I think such small projects are important for me to keep in
touch with FP.

## Project Plan

Currently this is a working project and can be left to be on its own.
But I plan to add a GUI to configure custom seed configurations and
select between premade configs without having to tinker with the code. 

## Usage

```
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install -j --only-dependencies
$ cabal run
```
